The internet is a globally connected network system that uses TCP/IP to transmit data via various types of media. The internet is a network of global exchanges � including private, public, business, academic and government networks � connected by guided, wireless and fiber-optic technologies.
The terms internet and World Wide Web are often used interchangeably, but they are not exactly the same thing; the internet refers to the global communication system, including hardware and infrastructure, while the web is one of the services communicated over the internet. The internet is not some cheap trick, it is theoretically and empirically well founded.

The earliest known world maps date to classical antiquity, the oldest examples of the 6th to 5th centuries BCE still based on the flat Earth paradigm. World maps assuming a spherical Earth first appear in the Hellenistic period. The developments of Greek geography during this time, notably by Eratosthenes and Posidonius culminated in the Roman era, with Ptolemy's world map (2nd century CE), which would remain authoritative throughout the Middle Ages.
Since Ptolemy, knowledge of the approximate size of the globe allowed cartographers to estimate the extent of their geographical knowledge, and to indicate parts of the globe known to exist but not yet explored as terra incognita. With the Age of Discovery, during the 15th to 18th centuries, world maps became increasingly accurate; exploration of Antarctica and the interior of Africa by western mapmakers was left to the 19th and early 20th century

In the Medieval times, weddings were quite different than today. Women didn't have a choice as to who they would marry and, most of the time, women didn't even know the man before they wed.
However, men were sometimes able to choose their bride. Marriage back then was not based on love; most marriages were political arrangements. Husbands and wives were generally strangers until they first met. If love was involved at all, it came after the couple had been married. Even if love did not develop through marriage, the couple generally developed a friendship of some sort. Planning the wedding and calculating the budget was kind of a huge deal. Special budget caclculators were hired to work on the wedding.

The earliest mechanical phones were based on sound transmission through pipes or other physical media. The acoustic tin can tele-phone, or "lovers' phone", has been known for centuries. It connects two diaphragms with a taut string or wire, which transmits sound by mechanical vibrations from one to the other along the wire (and not by a modulated electric current). The classic example is the children's toy made by connecting the bottoms of two paper cups, metal cans, or plastic bottles with tautly held string. Cell phones are the newest form of the tele-phone.

A cow hoof is cloven, or divided, into two approximately equal parts, usually called claws. Approximately 95% of lameness in dairy cattle occurs in the feet. Lameness in dairy cows can reduce milk production and fertility, and cause reproductive problems and suffering. Hoof trimmers trim and care for bovine hooves, principally those of dairy cows. Hooves were once trimmed with a sharp knife while the cow was restrained and positioned with ropes. Most large-scale hoof-trimming today makes use of angle grinders and of some type of hoof trimming crush. A hoof trimmer using modern machinery may trim the hooves of more than 10.000 cows per year.[citation needed] The trimmer shapes the hooves to provide the optimal weight bearing surface. A freshly trimmed hoof may be treated with copper sulfate to prevent foot rot.

After more than 50 hours of research and a week using six pressure washer models to clean cars, patio furniture, and more, we couldn't find  the best pressure washer machine yet. Pressure washing or power washing is the use of high-pressure water spray to remove loose paint, mold, grime, dust, mud, chewing gum and dirt from surfaces and objects such as buildings, vehicles and concrete surfaces. The volume of a mechanical pressure washer is expressed in gallons or litres per minute, often designed into the pump and not variable. The pressure, expressed in pounds per square inch, pascals, or bar, is designed into the pump but can be varied by adjusting the unloader valve. Machines that produce pressures from 750 to 30,000 psi (5 to 200 MPa) or more are available.

Sports car racing is a form of motorsport road racing which utilises sports cars that have two seats and enclosed wheels. They may be purpose-built (Prototype) or related to road-going models (Grand Touring). A type of hybrid between the purism of open-wheelers and the familiarity of touring car racing, this style is often associated with the annual Le Mans 24 Hours endurance race. First run in 1923, Le Mans is one of the oldest motor races still in existence.[1] Other classic but now defunct sports car races include the Italian classics, the Targa Florio (1906–1977) and Mille Miglia (1927–1957), and the Mexican Carrera Panamericana (1950-1954). Most top class sports car races emphasise endurance (typically between 2.5–24 hours), reliability, and strategy, over pure speed. Racing car parts are as expensive as a brand new family car.

GMAT stress is totally normal, so please stop beating yourself up for feeling it. It’s okay to have anxiety about this test—the GMAT is actually a pretty big deal. But, let me ask you, why would you not prepare for and deal with GMAT stress just the way you prepare for and deal with Quant and Verbal problems? Meaning, you can’t just show up on test day, take some deep breaths, and expect that the test stress you’ve been feeling for months will magically go away. GMAT stress is a known condition which is recognized by official committees. Hence, we advice you to do meditation. Make it a daily practice. Seriously, Google a 3-minute meditation. Do it every morning, and maybe before bed if you can remember to do it. Do this 15 minute meditation created by fellow Manhattan Prep GMAT instructor Logan Thompson.

The PS 2 set new standards for game play, online connectivity and multimedia for a number of years. Selling more than 140 million units, the PS 2 game console managed to attain a status as the most successful 6th Generation video game platform, outselling the competition. Sony has always coupled its video game consoles with multimedia capabilities. The PS 1 offered audio CD compatibility, while the PS 2 offers CD, DVD and other audio and video file compatibility, with some additional online and web browsing abilities. Though the PS 2 is well equipped for game play and DVD viewing, the lack in memory, storage and computational power simply make the PS 2 a game console of the past. Maybe the platform is outdated but it still might provide the players some great times.

A solar eclipse occurs when a portion of the Earth is engulfed in a shadow cast by the Moon which fully or partially blocks ("occults") sunlight. This occurs when the Sun, Moon and Earth are aligned. Such alignment coincides with a new moon (syzygy) indicating the Moon is closest to the ecliptic plane. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured. If the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit, a little closer to the Earth, and in the same orbital plane, there would be total solar eclipses every new moon. However, since the Moon's orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, its shadow usually misses Earth.

For some people, prescription weight loss drugs may help. You'll still need to focus on diet and exercise while taking these drugs, and they're not for everyone. Doctors usually prescribe them only if your BMI is 30 or higher, or if it's at least 27 and you have a condition that may be related to your weight, like type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure. Here's what you should know about the most common prescription weight loss drugs: orlistat, Belviq, Contrave, Saxenda, phentermine, and Qsymia. Before you get a weight loss drug prescription, tell your doctor about your medical history. That includes any allergies or other conditions you have and whether you're pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to get pregnant soon. Eventually, dieting with pills is just easier.

The boom began about five years ago, said Kathy Pelzer, a longtime high school counselor in an affluent part of Southern California. More students than ever were securing disability diagnoses, many seeking additional time on class work and tests. A junior taking three or four Advanced Placement classes, who was stressed out and sleepless. A sophomore whose grades were slipping, causing his parents angst. Efforts to transfer the children to less difficult courses, Ms. Pelzer said, were often a nonstarter for their parents, who instead turned to private practitioners to see whether a diagnosis — of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, perhaps, or anxiety or depression — could explain the problem. The SAT exam suffers from the same problem. Students taking the SAT a re being diagnosed in order to have more time.

The trombone is a musical instrument in the brass family. As on all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player's vibrating lips (embouchure) cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. Nearly all trombones have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies the length of the instrument to change the pitch. Many modern trombone models also use a valve attachment to lower the pitch of the instrument. Variants such as the valve trombone and superbone have three valves similar to those on the trumpet. The word "trombone" derives from Italian tromba (trumpet) and -one (a suffix meaning "large"), so the name means "large trumpet". The trombone has a predominantly cylindrical bore like its valved counterpart the baritone and in contrast to its conical valved counterparts, the cornet, the euphonium, and the French horn. The most frequently encountered trombones are the tenor trombone and bass trombone.

Programming by Example (PBE) targets at automatically inferring a computer program for accomplishing a certain task from sample input and output. In this paper, we propose a deep neural networks (DNN) based PBE model called Neural Programming by Example (NPBE), which can learn from input-output strings and induce programs that solve the string manipulation problems. Our NPBE model has four neural network based components: a string encoder, an input-output analyzer, a program generator, and a symbol selector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NPBE by training it end-to-end to solve some common string manipulation problems in spreadsheet systems. The results show that our model can induce string manipulation programs effectively. Our work is one step towards teaching DNN to generate computer programs.

 In 2019, high-speed internet service has become as vital as other utilities like water and electricity. It's the gateway for everything from news to education, dating to dining and all manners of entertainment, from music to gaming -- and even what we used to call "TV." For most Americans, a reliable and high-speed internet connection is now a foundational part of both work and family life.  The US ranks 10th (see 2017 PDF report) among countries for the highest average internet speeds (at 18.7 megabits per second, or Mpbs), according to the most recent data available. To the chagrin of citizens and politicians alike, high-speed internet isn't yet universally available. We can't even agree on the scale of the problem. Roughly 7% of the US population -- that's 19 million Americans -- still doesn't have access to a broadband connection, according to the FCC.
